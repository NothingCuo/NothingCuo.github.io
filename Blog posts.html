                <p>September 5th<br>
                    Everything seems to go well as I expected. I succeeded in expanding my circle of friends.<br> To be honest, it was not difficult at all because we have known each other on Facebook for about 1 or 2 months. <br> However, we haven't met face-to-face before so we just had our first interactions today.<br> We shared a moment, took some pictures,...<br> Everyone is likely to have a sense of humor.<br> They made me fall about their stories. <br> That day was such a long day and it was certainly a good memory.

                <p> September 20th<br>
                    The weather was so terrible and I made a stupid mistake.<br> I forgot to bring the umbrella along during the heavy rain.<br> Then I had to walk all the way to my school<br> The result was unsurprising that I got completely wet.<br> Ahh, how unlucky I was!
